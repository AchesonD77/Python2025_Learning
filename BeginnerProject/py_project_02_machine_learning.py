# machine learning is a technique; we build a model or engine and give it lots of data.
# example: we gave thousands or tens of pictures of cats and dogs,
# our model will find and then learn patterns and the inpute data,
# and then we can give the new picture and ask it
# more input data, more accurate

# step1 import the Data
# are often comes from CSV file

# step2 clean the data
# remove/convert error, duplicate, incomplete data

# step3 split the data into Training/Test sets
# (80% data for training, 20% for testing)

# step4 create a model,
# selecting an algorithm to analyze the data. such as decision trees, neural newtworks and so on.
# depends on what problems we want to solve, and what types of the input

# step5 train our model
# feed our training data, our model then looking for the pattern of the data

# step6 make predictions

# step7 evaluate the predictions and measure their accuracy

# then get back to our model, to try different algorithms, or fine-tune the parameters
